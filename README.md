# Procedural Generation with Style Transfer 

This project explores various terrain generation algorithms, visualizes them, and applies neural style transfer to influence the generated terrains.

## Structure
- `terrain/generation/`: Terrain generation algorithms (Perlin, Fractal Perlin, etc.)
- `terrain/visualization/`: Visualization tools (PyVista)
- `terrain/style_transfer/`: Neural style transfer utilities (planned)
- `scripts/`: Example scripts to run generation and visualization

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the example script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/generate_and_visualize.py
   ```

## Roadmap
- [x] Project skeleton
- [ ] Implement Perlin and Fractal Perlin noise generation
- [ ] Visualization with PyVista
- [ ] Neural style transfer integration
